# Gas station app CRUD interface

Implementing a basic CRUD interface for the Scopevisio takehome.

The task was to present how you could do it, but I figured working on implementing it would also be a good exercise.

Run `psql -f ./config/db/schema.sql` to create the PostgreSQL database along with the tables.

Update the environment variables in your .env file to work with config/config.js.
